# TOHacks-project
 
Smart Recycling is our submission for TOHacks 2022. It is a cashback program that rewards users for sustainable recycling practices. 

The program generates scannable QR codes for different types of products that redirect users to a website containing recycling information for the specific product. An image detection program is then inputted an image that is provided by the user and if it is detected to be the correct recycling bin for the product, the user is given back a small percentage of the product's original purchase price.

The .html files in this repository have only been included for judging purposes, and the actual website is hosted at [anudevgill.github.io](https://anudevgill.github.io/). The Github repository link for the webiste is https://github.com/anudevgill/anudevgill.github.io.git
